    Adding support for embedded textures (#890)
    
    * Adding support for embedded textures
    
    FBX files may have texture data embedded in them. ASSIMP supports this but GearVRF did not. This patch adds support for embedded textures. It also fixes missing textures by supplying a small 16x16 whit
    
    * hiding texture cache
    
    As Mihail suggested I should hide the texture cache. I have moved all
    the GVRContext texture loading routines to GVRAssetLoader. For
    compatibility had to change some of the async callbacks.
    Expect further reform in texture loading but not before the next
    release. This patch addresses only a small part of the problem.
    
    * backed out stupid change
    
    * changed deprecated texture load APIs to use new ones
    
    * Make GVRAndroidResource and GVRContext.loadMesh backwards compatible
    
    GearVRf was throwing some IOExceptions on the floor and not passing them
    on. I changed loadMesh to pass on the exception but this broke some
    samples. Now loadMesh returns null if there is an exception.
    GVRAndroidResource says it throws an exception but it really doesn't. I
    took out the "throw" but this broke samples so I put it back.
    
    * clear texture cache on restart
    
    and restore gradle properties
    
    * reset default texture
    
    * fix issue with cubemap shader
    
    * fixed problem with cubemap texture loading
    
    this fixes the issue with gvr-cubemap
    
    * fixed bug in GVRCylinderSceneObject
    
    It was not using the material passed in
    
    * fixed regression in cubemap reflection shader
